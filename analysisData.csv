It's a great place to come home to after a long day soaking up all NYC has to offer.  There are lots of great places to eat,  especially Dominican and other Caribbean food since there's a big population in the neighborhood.  Our favorite is Malecon,  five blocks up on 175st,  where you can get the most delicious chicken of your life.  It's also super cheap--you can get a whole bird for $11! We're also very close to Fort Tryon Park--just 20 blocks north (a 20 minute walk or 3 quick subway stops).  The park is the best kept secret of Manhattan--better than Central Park in my opinion,  since tourists don't typically find their way up here so it's never crowded.  Fort Tryon is also home to the Clositers,  the Met Art Museum's Medieval Art satellite,  housed in a medieval monastery that was transported in pieces from Europe and reassembled here brick by brick in the 1950s.

about me:
I am a craft-artist/entrepreneur-mom who works at home as a designer while running arthouse residencies.

My life evolves around 4 things: 
1. My special needs son who is adorable and friendly
2. Life long search of love of a health - dream balance lifestyle
3. My friends
4. My family

I am an old school self-made entrepreneur. I work from Queens, Bronx and soon will be in Brooklyn. I Love making craft-art, and I have an Interior with Architectural design background. I was a long-tme hairstylist. My favorite is mix media  art, venturing into installation art dominant in paper and fiber bc they are beautiful and versatile materials to work with. I am learning to structure my art practice hoping to meet and collaborate with great artists. 

My dream on art residency is to make an art loft building in brooklyn / manhattan dedicated to art and design, unifying all individuals of NYC into one big family.

Currently I conduct a 1 to 2 time a month weekend art group for females and children of special needs.  I feel this is my way to give back to my community bc I am good with my hands and putting people together. Stay tune, for we are doing airbnb Art group experiences so don't forget to join us if you have a special skill up your sleeve!

I have a talkative friendly 8 year old boy who took the initiative to assist me on helping guests and roommates to a more enjoyable time staying with us. We always welcome people whose looking to connect with others - especially die-hard working artists.

My hosting style -
According to the Airbnb - 5 things I cant live without rule: 

#1. I LOVE traveling and learn about different cultures of other people in all parts of the world. Knowing where they come from and appreciate their lifestyles and learn from it to improve my own (I have a list of guests whom I plan to visit after they return back to their country!)

#2. My goal is to make harmonious relationships with art and culture while uniting individuals and families. I feel that if we all learn to see others relative to ourselves, we are more compassionate toward one another and accept that we are all related to each other one way or another. 

#3. I can't live without my son who makes me laugh all day any day of the week. Our bond had grown significantly day after day and he inspires me to be the best I can be. Traveling to every place on my bucketlist, I am the most luckiest mom whose able to take him with me on my journey. Together, we went to China, Hong Kong, Italy, Canada and Japan. We are planning to loop around Europe, Its our next goal! (check us out and follow us on 

Insta gram:
@monliudesigns_and_art

4. My favorite thing to do with my guests is making time to gather for outing and Art making! I dont care what we ll be doing as ling as it gets our creative juice flowing! It is the reason made a females art group experience. hiring teachers to keep us learning new arts interesting.

I also like waking up to do yoga/meditate, have breakfast at the porch with a cup of morning tea/coffee with my housemates and then plan the day. If I'm by myself I would take a nap midday and do my housework when everyones out, meditate, and gather my thoughts on new coming design projects. I-Love-Yoga! I wish to meet a roommate whom I can practice on a daily basis! (My favorite yoga studio is too far its all the way downtown, I get to go but not as often as I wish.)

5. Lastly, I love making creative things! Art is my play thing. so I strive to build art groups that would help me build relationships (especially women friends) with like minded people around things we all love to do. It helps me keep a healthy mindset so I can work toward my dreams, and that is what makes me wake up everyday. I just want a healthy, stable lifestyle for me and my baby,  do all the great things with friends, family and love ones while being able to live by my dreams and my values.

Q: What's it's like to have me as a host?
A: The most tedious part is the reservation is  the acceptance process. I require people to exchange social media information, read some rules to keep this place in harmony. once you are ok with everthing, you can ask questions and reply to accept the terms and then I will accept the reservation.

Q: Whats it like meeting me? 
A: Well Im pretty real and too direct for some people at times. If anything you would notice me at first is that Im not the type to 'fly by the seat of the pants'. I can be shy to talk in the beginning but Im just human who like to socialize and have fun with everyone and Im pretty open minded as long as it dont compromise me and my family! 

My moto - ""communication is the glue of all relationships"". Im basically kind to people who reciprocates. I have my moments with responsibilitie, so sometimes easy going doesnt always show through easily. You will notice I ask alot of questions in the beginning before accepting your reservation. I'm very careful with who comes into the livingspace of me and my family. My longterm housemates will tell you that they feel safer because I am that way. (I think you have to these days, especially with such fragile-swift online transactions. excuse me I'm not lying, I just bought a $300 coat on a touch of a button the other day!) When you're a mom and a housing provider you must be able to protect your child and your living environment and sustain it.

In truth, I love having a simple meal and beer together with others by the fire pit (my roommate says she'll build one but she left before that happened haha), then look at stars in the night sky, have some good talks and laughs outside from business! Yes I am human and I have emotions maybe more than you! lol

Q: How does the space function? 
A: Just keep it simple. You have to know, We are not a guest house or a hotel, so cleaning up after yourself is a must. do your dishes on time!

We are all roommates who share a living facility together, so everyone is responsible to clean up after yourself after each use so others can simply enjoy the space like you do. keep the place clean throughout the week before I get to cleaning on Sundays/ Mondays or have my housekeeper come to help. 

We normally function as place with long-term roomates, as 'independent' individuals sharing common areas like the eat in kitchen, bathroom, porch etc. We are trying it out on airbnb to see if it work out well. if not we will stop and go back to doing only longterm.

Q: What are the basic rules of the place?
A: There are other guests as well as residents here who stays long term 6 month to a year. I consider managing this house as one of my hobbies and I like blending with people. but I ask please respect my work hours -
don't literally come knocking on my door for internet password at midnight. ( To play is fine!) I'm best reached by text message and if I dont reply it means I am unavailable, thankyou!

Honestly, this is gonna sound like a recording tape a mom would make - we are all adults, but we left our nest and dont live at home where mom always cleans up after us all the time and for free bc we are in NYC (You will miss her when you are in NYC lol) Here, we put out our own trash, do our own dishes. Trash goes into the trash bin and recycles in the recycle bin. It is important that we ask our roommates and guests to develop healthy living habits, clean up after yourself each use of the facility so others can enjoy after you. *I do most of the house cleaning on the weekend and partial throughout the week especially when someone leaves and when someones checking in, so please keep clean throughout the week for you and other guests can enjoy a more cleanliness of the space throughout the week.

When eating, try to stay out of your room as much as possible. Eat in the common areas so we can ensure no unwelcoming pestie friends comes uninvited. please make the best use of the facilities, share the space with others kindly so all our housemates can enjoy the space as you would.
The following is what we ask for:
*please be an honest person, and be open to communicate maturely.
*You must be ALCOHOL and SUBSTANCE ABUSE-FREE (No drugs or frequent alcohol users here.)
*fairly abide by our agreements such as - pay rent on time, keep the place clean
*promote harmony and respect others space, stay away from others property. *Becareful with fire and water running in the house or you will pay for the damages.

If you can keep up with all that, you are pretty much freedom on your own.

Q: What does a candidate need to rent for long term?
A: To rent long term/permanent with us, we require renters to stay 3 months or more, submit a proof of income, go through a moderately intensive signing of the terms and conditions, prior to staying in the house. It is a documentation of the dos and don'ts so that you me and everybody else in the house can have a peace of mind.

About my experience on Airbnb for  years - before airbnb I was listing for 10+ years on 'C-glist NYC'. you usually can find my postings by these keywords: ""180 ST.STATION 2/5 TRAIN"". or ""Flushing Chinatown share a room"" for the queens locations.

My moto on life -

"" Communication is the basis of all relationships. Without it, its just merely codepency and that is not healthy.""

""Sure, I'll let you use my backyard as long as you leave me a collateral and return it the way you received it"".

""I build on failure to fill the negative gaps using it as a stepping stone to success. failure is the mother of success. without it, success cannot be born.""

""Never let others dictate your direction because you are the only one in the world who knows what exactly you want.""

""Don't let others make your heart stiff. Life would be nothing without genuine joy and laughter.""

Which means there are some stairs on your way to the apartment,  so being in decent shape is critical.  Light-filled one bedroom apt with separate kitchen and living room,  wonderfully comfy Bloomingdale's bed,  Wifi internet,  AC and abundant heat (in winter).  The apartment mirrors the color of the neighborhood,  with lots of yellows and blues and natural streaming light.   DVD player,  small TV with NO CABLE,  lots of books,  and fully stocked cooking equipment.  Close to all East Village and Lower East Side dining and entertainment.    -Edi and the Wolf -Zum Schneiders  -Esperanto -9th Street Espresso -Supper -The Summit -The Wayland,   -Minca Ra","Alphabet City is tucked away near the East River and East Village.   It is coming up in a major way with tons of bars and restaurants.   The neighborhood is quiet and friendly,  and a rare opportunity to see how real NY'ers live.   However,  that means it is a 12/15 minute walk to the nearest train.   So if you are adverse to a little walk to the train,  it may not be the best apartment for you.  I find it gets you the real version of NYC,  seeing the locals . ","Since it is summer,  the apartment,  AND NYC are very warm.  I have AC which you can leave on during the day when it is really hot.  Otherwise,  try to make due with not using the AC during the day when you are out and about.  Bring plenty of warm weather clothes and make sure to hydrate in the summer. ","The F train is a ten-fifteen minute walk to the south and west.   I actually love the walk,  it gives you time to soak in the surroundings and the culture that makes the East Village so interesting.   The L train is a 15-20 minute walk north and west to 14th St.  and 1st Avenue.   The L takes you to Williamsburg,  a must-see while you're here.   There are CITIbikes on 5th and Ave C.   You can pay to ride them from station to station.   Also,  UBER and taxi's are plentiful right outside the apartment. ","Keys are accessed at CITY CO PILOT,  a storefront that holds the keys.  You first have to go to the CITY CO PILOT and get the keys.  I will give you a code.  It is located at: 166 Allen Street in the Lower East Side,  close to the 1st Ave F train stop.  If you are checking in late,  there are instructions to follow to get the keys from their lock box.   The colorful key works the first two doors to the building.  The other keys work the apartment locks,  but only the bottom lock will be locked.  You must drop the keys off at CITY CO PILOT after you check out. ","I will be in LA,  so I am not there to troubleshoot for you.  I will leave the number of a contact in case you need some assistance. ","NO SMOKING inside,  and please gently close the front door.  Make sure you close the door and don't let it slam shut.   Respect the place as it is your own!","Chris","2011-07-10","New York, New York, United States","World traveler, entertainer, writer, New Yorker/Kentuckian, fun-loving, creative, athletic.","within an hour","100%","N/A","f","Alphabet City",2,2,"['email', 'phone', 'reviews', 'kba']","t","t","New York, NY, United States","Alphabet City","East Village","Manhattan","New York","NY","10009","New York","New York, NY","US","United States","t","Apartment","Entire home/apt",2,1,1,1,"Real Bed","TV,Internet,Wifi, Air conditioning ,Kitchen, Free street parking , Buzzer/wireless intercom ,Heating, Smoke detector , First aid kit , Fire extinguisher ,Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,Iron, translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49 , translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50 , Coffee maker ,Refrigerator, Dishes and silverware , Cooking basics ,Oven,Stove.",NA,190,NA,NA,400,125,1,0,3,30,3,3,30,30,3,30,"today","t",7,20,27,27,147,36,"2011-12-19","2019-06-30",97,10,9,10,10,10,9,"f","","","f","f","strict_14_with_grace_period","f","f",1,1,0,0,1.6

Every time I'm in town I try out a new restaurant, catch a show, or go shopping.  Currently on my bucket list is checking out some of these amazing summer festivals NYC has to offer, I just always seem to be in a different state when they occur! I hope you enjoy your experience here and please share your thoughts, pictures, and recommendations!

","","","","","","","Jacques","2011-12-23","New York, New York, United States","Hello! 

I have lived in New York City all my life, and have lived at my current place for two years.. I am a student in Environmental Science and play music in two bands around Brooklyn, one for children (for example birthday parties for 5 year olds) and one rock and roll band, but I don't drink or smoke (don't mind other people who do)... I read alot of books and listen to alot of radio shows about science and international news- I ride my bike everywhere. If you stay at my house I will try and find you a bike!

I've travelled a little bit, to Europe (Sweden, Slovenia, Spain, France, Holland, Belgium, Germany), and to Mexico (D.F. mostly) and Israel but haven't left ny in the past few years. 
In the summer I try to go to the beach as much as possible. In the winter I visit friend's houses and drink tea. One day I would like to visit Africa, South America, the Artic and Papua New Guinea, (if I can ever save the money for the airline ticket :)  )
I can't live without books, friends, going for a walk once a day, trying to learn other languages (speak spanish, working on french, have taken classes in Greek, Japanese, Hebrew and Portuguese), and my family (they live in San Francisco)..

Our house is medium sized, but it has plenty of space for privacy, if you need your space after a long trip-  or for hanging out- we have a projector sometimes watch movies or listen to records in the living room- As far as hosting goes, I love New York and have many friends involved in all sides of it, from the arts/ music scenes to restaurants to activism- I know most neighborhoods in the city pretty well and am always happy to give people advice on where to go and what to do so they don't just see the stuff everyone sees. 

嗨喽,我叫Jacques,(我不会讲中文,这个介绍是我的一个房客帮我翻译的)

我住在布鲁克林(Brooklyn)一个安全的街区｡我有两个房间,一大一小｡我的公寓附近有一些酒吧和餐厅,离威廉斯堡(Williamsburg)和劳德代尔堡(Fort Green)比较近｡去曼哈顿下城区(Lower Manhattan)的话半小时就到了｡

我是个玩音乐的土生土长的纽约客｡我有个25岁的开服饰店的室友Cat｡我们支持多元性取向人权并为LGBT友好｡房子里很安静,偶尔有时候我朋友们会过来一起看电影听音乐｡

公寓里有无线网,厨房,浴室,浴巾,房间里有个大床和换洗的床单被套｡超市和洗衣店都与公寓只隔着一条街｡你会有你自己的钥匙｡房间适合两人住但是有一次招待房客四个人也挤下来了｡

规则

唯一一条规则就是禁止抽烟,嗑药,宠物和来过夜的房客外的人｡务必不要把吃的放在厨房的桌子上｡出门的时候一定要用钥匙锁门(门不能自动锁)｡退房的时候在门外把钥匙从大门中间的小凿丢进门里面就好了｡","within a day","71%","80%","f","Bedford-Stuyvesant",4,4,"['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'kba']","t","t","Brooklyn, NY, United States","Brooklyn","Bedford-Stuyvesant","Brooklyn","Brooklyn","NY","11205","New York","Brooklyn, NY","US","United States","t","Apartment","Private room",3,1,1,1,"Real Bed","Wifi, Air conditioning ,Kitchen, Free street parking , Family/kid friendly , Suitable for events , Smoke detector , First aid kit , Fire extinguisher ,Essentials,Shampoo, Lock on bedroom door , Private entrance , Hot water , Host greets you .",NA,65,425,NA,NA,10,1,10,7,90,7,7,90,90,7,90,"7 months ago","t",0,0,0,0,2,0,"2012-05-24","2012-05-29",100,9,9,10,10,9,10,"f","","","f","f","strict_14_with_grace_period","f","f",4,0,4,0,0.02

It's one of the most fun neighborhoods in New York and I'd encourage you to take advantage of being here! It's somewhat rugged in appearance but that is part of what started drawing artists out here in the 2004-2008 period as Williamsburg became more expensive after the Bloomberg-era rezoning of the waterfront.   There are amazing restaurants and bars,  as well as coffee shops,  stores,  and music venues,  that I have listed in the Guidebook.  Williamsburg is also very close by on the J or L -- you can get there in 10 minutes.  I understand of course that many people come here to go to Manhattan and the subway on Broadway can take you to Manhattan in 15 minutes (during rush hour). ","I have a few home security cameras installed (one facing the living room,  one facing the street,  and one in the hallway).  Also,  I do have a dog here but it is TINY (about 6 pounds) and extremely well-behaved. ","The J train at subway will take you to downtown Manhattan in 15 minutes at rush hour.  You can connect in Manhattan from the J to the 4/5/6 and be in Soho in another 5 minutes and the Upper East Side in as little as 40 minutes total.   The L train is close by as well at Morgan Avenue.   If you wish to drive,  there is lots of free parking in this neighborhood on the street,  so I wouldn't worry too much about that.  We are close to the Williamsburg Bridge,  so an Uber/Lyft to/from Manhattan late at night is $20,  or $10 if you pool it,  which isn't bad if you're feeling tired and don't want to deal with the noise of the subway.   For getting to and from JFK Airport,  you can take the J subway line directly to Airtrain,  and be at your airport terminal in 75 minutes.  You can also take a ridesharing platform if you have a lot of luggage and it's 30 minutes without traffic,  but it's a flat rate of approximately $40 the last time I checked. ","You will have access to the kitchen,  living room,  all bathrooms,  and of course your room.  Basically,  everything you see in the photos,  plus the washer drier!","I try to be around as much as possible and am available to answer questions as needed.  I live here but I understand that many guests want their space,  so our relationship really depends on you!","-- If you wish to cook you are welcome to,  but I ask that you clean up after yourself -- Please respect everyone's need for quiet between 9. 00 pm and 9. 00 am -- No parties,  no events and no guests -- No smoking in the apartment  -- Please remove hair from the drain after you shower to keep it from clogging -- Do not leave any personal items in the common areas in special the bathroom,  otherwise they will be removed by the cleaner Thank you so much for your cooperation!!","Cristina And Sasha","2016-11-15","New York, New York, United States","Cristina is originally from Latin America but moved to the USA many years ago for business, first in the Southeastern USA, and now lives in this Brooklyn townhouse full-time and loves it here.

Sasha is from Omaha originally but has lived in New York on and off for the last 10 years. The one great thing about being from Omaha is it makes you ready for the weather in NYC, which is very mild by comparison! 

We are both passionate about providing the best possible experience for our guests, because we decided to move to New York after staying with friends in similar circumstances and just falling in love with the energy of the place and the endless variety of neighborhoods, things to do, and people from all around the world with very different worldviews and motivations. 

Having traveled around the world before and after Airbnb ""blew up"" and got popular, we understand the traveler's perspective and know there are certain things you just expect to be taken care of and don't want to have to think about when you have to find your way around a new place, often in a tight time-frame. 

Therefore, we strive to make your visit here as easy and straightforward as possible, with self-check-in, spotless bathrooms and kitchens, wifi internet that always works, and linens that are always truly clean.

I have lived in this neighborhood as a single woman for the last 8 years and have never had a problem.  It is a tight knit community so it's common to see a lot of the same characters out and about on a daily basis.  They want to keep their community safe just as much as we want to live in a safe community.  Times Square,  the Heart of NYC,  can often be more dangerous then small neighborhoods like this since there are so many people.  Always be AWARE of your surroundings.  That said,  it is common,  in all areas of NYC to be talked to by strangers.  More often than not they are flirting,  but sometimes they just want to be friendly.

I am a frequent traveler as well, my work takes me world-wide on a weekly basis so I know how to appreciate a good location and good hospitality when I encounter one :-)
My story is pretty exciting: I have an apartment in the heart of Manhattan, and an apartment in the best location in Tel Aviv. I am traveling back and forth all year round, and in between I fly to other countries to work like England and India...
Since it isn't cheap to maintain two beautiful apartments in these two great cities, I'm making sure to rent each space when I'm not there... Smart, no? :-) So when I'm traveling to Tel Aviv I rent my space in NYC, and when I'm in NYC I rent my space in Israel!
It is my first priority to make sure your stay in Israel or in New York will be truly unforgettable and this is why I offer these wonderful apartments which are located in the best areas you can imagine, city center. 

Please take a few minutes to look at the pictures of the apartment you're interested in and feel free to contact me if you have any questions! I take my hosting in AirBnb VERY seriously and I will make sure your stay will be an experience to remember.

I've lived and worked overseas, mostly in Asia and the Middle East, for the last 6 years and am excited to keep the adventure alive in New York City. I stay pretty active so if you have questions about running routes, climbing gyms, or anything else, don't be shy about asking.

There are many restaurants,  bars and shopping locations within a few blocks and Lincoln Square is just up the street if you're interested in the Ballet or Opera.

Generally,  I do not help guests with luggage as this courtesy has been taken advantage of in the past.  In the winter time the heat is radiated by a hot pipe in the room which vents excess steam.  The noise is negligible and sounds like a light hiss.  If it's cold outside,  it's best not to touch the pipe as it will be rather hot.

Welcome to my great international family in New York. Let me show you around.
I live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. 
 I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.
As a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.
In addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (Website hidden by Airbnb) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations. All rooms are new furnished, AC, WiFi and Cable, all included in the price. I also can offer you occasional free skating classes with me at the local rink.
Welcome to my apartment. I know you are going to feel like you are home. I am waiting for you my new friend. Welcome to New York!

Having a thirst for knowledge and a curious mind, I love learning about people and world around me. It's with this attitude that I approach the sharing world of airbnb and why I make sure to leave others with great experiences.

I'm attentive and always available to my guests without being intrusive :)

Tree-lined streets and endless cafes and restaurants off the tourist paths of NYC!","I have a legal Airbnb listing,  which is advantageous for a long stay.  You wouldn't want to be uprooted b/c your host doesn't have permission to rent out on airbnb (which can be the case even with those who own rather than rent,  because their co-op board might not approve. . . . )! I very occasionally need to get something from the living room/kitchen,  but won't do so while you are in the apartment and never ever without your permission.   This is a second floor unit but is still unusually quiet for NYC because of good double pane windows.  If you need total silence for a great nice of sleep,  then NYC might not be a good choice.  I hope I don't sound unwelcoming--I am simply trying to disclose as much info for the newcomer to the city. ","In case you need to leave this safe beautiful vibrant neighborhood,  you are steps away from a few subway/Metro stations,  Citi Bike rentals,  plenty of taxi cabs,  and bus lines. . . .  And I'm happy to help you learn how to get around easiest.   Or you can walk to mostly everything you need!","Enjoy your coffee makers,  coffee,  tea,  AC,  etc   Let me know if you need a blow dryer,  thick or thin pillows,  washcloth,  etc.   No unregistered guests! Washers and Dryers are card-operated,  large,  and in the basement.  Having washers and dryers in the building is a luxury in this city.  For smaller or bigger loads,  there is also a very clean coin-operated laundromat across the street and a few doors east.

It does open for fresh air,  and there is air conditioning,  but we chose to cover the skylight with a white cover to keep the room cool and keep the light out in the morning.

Getting to Times Square,  for example,  will take about 40 minutes.  There are also extensive bus routes in the neighborhood.  The JFK and LaGuardia airports are easy to get to and from with public transit as well.

Who we are: Our Principles

1) We Grow Our “Alumni” Community:
We don’t have a membership with fee charges. Instead, we do take care of the growing “referral alumni community” with feedback. We believe our alumni understand well the value of our fair price table and its services. Our alumni have put 200+ reviews in 2019, 75% of reviews are with five stars, 97% of reviews are four+ stars. Our cumulative alumni came from 74 unique nationalities and expanding. We welcome any new guest, from a fresh search, who will become our future alumni.

2) A simple/fair one month price, Transparency is our matter:
Our minimum stay price is simple one month each for fair, not a discounted price for three months nor six months. Our one-month prices are already competitive (range from $1,100 to $1,500, 90% of our 170 rooms are under $1,650 per month), compare with others’ price with discounted for three-six months. 25%+ of our lived-customers extended a few months of their original stay in 2019. All-inclusive co-living environment, furnished private room, from the day one.

3) We do care about the local property industry to grow together:
We are providing co-living communities for the guest by assisting property owners to facilitate their under-managed property to live. We care about the customer’s community, of course, and at the same time, the property owner’s community, the vendor’s community, and our team to unite together on our digital platform.

4) Privacy is the first:
We won’t offer a BBQ party to join:). Our priority for the guest is their privacy, quiet environment, and security. Our team will take care of cleaning for common space weekly, so our kitchen/dining are always comfortable space. For the guest who expects to expand their community-based life, our office at WeWork provides you day/after work communities. We just moved our head office to the newest WeWork offices in Long Island City, all subway lines can reach from Queens Plaza, join us anytime at WeWork terrace!.

5) We know Co-Living for 10 years.
Our founder started the co-living business from his own apartment after he couldn’t find an appropriate price accommodation for his first three months’ stay in New York. All of our team lived/known co-living rooms, so we understand what the customer feels/needs next. “We are co-living roommates, who serve for co-living guests.”

6) A sustainable business models to share goods with everyone:
We won’t invest luxurious buildings like a hotel, nor a garden space for a party. We simply rent the existing empty rooms and townhouses from owners, put IKEA type of furniture in, and listed the cleaned room on multiple digital platforms. We grow by our operational profit base, which comes from the guests paid at a fair price and profit back to the owners. The key driver for our growth is not the tangible number of rooms; our growth driver is understanding how to care for the guests and rooms 24/7, the intangible value within.","within an hour","100%","69%","f","Harlem",137,137,"['email', 'phone', 'jumio', 'offline_government_id', 'selfie', 'government_id', 'identity_manual', 'work_email']","t","f","Queens, NY, United States","Sunnyside","Sunnyside","Queens","Queens","NY","11377","New York","Queens, NY","US","United States","t","Apartment","Private room",1,1,1,1,"Real Bed","TV,Wifi,Kitchen, Free street parking ,Heating, Smoke detector , Fire extinguisher ,Hangers, Laptop friendly workspace , Hot water , Bed linens ,Microwave,Refrigerator, Dishes and silverware , Cooking basics ,Oven,Stove, Long term stays allowed ,Other, Trash can .",NA,34,NA,NA,0,30,1,0,30,365,30,30,365,365,30,365,"today","t",12,42,72,347,3,2,"2018-08-18","2020-01-31",100,10,9,10,10,10,10,"f","","","f","f","moderate","f","f",136,3,133,0,0.16

If you are visiting the city on your own this might be the place for you.  The sofa bed opens up as a real bed.  Quiet and serene! I will most likely be around to host you.  Located on Riverside Drive,  one of the most beautiful avenues in Manhattan (I might be biased) you can't miss! Easy to get around with multiple subway and bus lines a few blocks away.  The studio can get a bit hot in the summer,  and if so I will give you my room with queen bed,  pics to follow.

I'm Len. I'm an amateur cook and vegetable gardener, an entrepreneur, and a traveler, by bicycle whenever possible. 

I live in the first floor apartment of my beautiful four story brownstone in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.  My cousin Tania  (https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/9772800) lives on the 2nd floor, and  we're both new hosts on AirBnB.

I try to assist all kinds of travelers by offering more than just some space and a bed. Explorers on a budget, families, young professionals, and experienced  business travelers have different needs, and Prospect Heights can be a great neighborhood for all of you.

For now, my listing(s) will be for travelers booking short stays in the next 60 days.

Tania's are aimed at visitors coming for longer stays or planning further ahead (no instant booking, but we respond quickly).

Let us know how we can help with your visit to Brooklyn and to New York City. 

AirBnB suggests sharing a ""five favorites"" list.  Why not?  I've traveled to dozens of destinations all over the United States and Canada, and around the world for work and for holidays.

Some of my all-time favorite trips, in no special order:

-Three weeks on the South Island of New Zealand.  My first time celebrating New-Years-Eve in Summer.  Made new friends and saw a landscape that is even more amazing in person than in the Lord of the Rings movies, no special effects required.

-My first visit to Vietnam in (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) for a weeklong wedding celebration then  a not-for-tourists tour led by locals: the newlyweds! (Yes, my friends still got a great honeymoon, after a week of hosting 10 guests, not just for a home, but for a country).

-Nine weeks bicycling in France. French food is probably my favorite, and with ""cyclotourism"" holidays there is almost no limit to how much I can enjoy without putting on pounds.

-My first ever cycling tour, from Los Angeles to San Francisco, with two old friends from high school not long after University.  The scenery, meeting other cyclists while camping, and the feeling of accomplishment each day made me a convert to vacations spent pedaling.

-On a business trip to Manilla in early November (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) ,  I got to watch a peaceful political revolution across the street from my room!  At the same time, I was following the news:  voters back home in the US were learning that it can take more than just an election to decide who gets to be president.

I'm originally from the UK - London to be exact - but have called Brooklyn home for many years.  I love to travel and have been all over the world.
My favorite travel memories have always come from “living like a local.”  When staying among the locals, you get to know the culture and customs of where you’re visiting.  You save money and meet great residents…not just other tourists!  
I love my Brooklyn neighborhood!  Brooklyn is the most diverse borough in New York City. My property is in a vibrant community made of many people of Caribbean and Jewish heritage.  Plus, it’s close to Brooklyn College, so there are a lot of students from all over the world here.

Experience life like a New Yorker!

In Brooklyn, I rent three  private  spaces within my large (one family) home. Each Private space consist of two rooms plus one or two private bathrooms.
All guest share one kitchen and the back deck.
We also have a private driveway that can be used by guest.
My rentals are ideal for travelers looking for a safe, clean place at an affordable rate!  

Most of my guests are coming from outside the country and find the accommodations to be just what they need and the neighborhood to be friendly and easy to get around.  Public transportation options is just steps away
The neighborhood offers easy travel to Manhattan- Union Square, Lower Manhattan, Park Slope, Brooklyn Museum, Prospect Park, Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, Downtown Brooklyn, Flatbush Shopping Area, Coney Island, Williamsburg Greenwich Village and anywhere else in NYC you wish to visit.

Disclaimer:
I would love to have you as a guest!  However…please know before you inquire about a booking that I do not accept guests who are intolerant of any race or religion.  If you are not comfortable around people who look or think different than you, this is not a good fit!  We offer a very good rate, but it’s not for everyone!!
 
I love my diverse New York City neighborhood and hope you will too!

I really enjoy getting people together and I love hosting dinners and meeting new people. I love NYC, I love my apartment and love sharing it with others!

As an Airbnb host, I like to be available however I'm needed - a restaurant recommendation, a tip about the shopping in the neighborhood, or even stocking the fridge with your favorite food. Please let me know how I can be helpful!

Becoming a member on airbnb was of interest to me and,   more I'm  happy to provide my spacious room for any individual who may be on vacation, in town for a conference, or just in need of a room.

Bushwick,  a working-class neighborhood that suffered looting and arson after the blackout of 1977,  began gentrifying around the early 2000s when artists started looking for cheap,  large industrial spaces there to use as studios.  In the early 1900s,  it was known for its thriving distilleries and breweries.  Now the neighborhood is seeing a renaissance,  as artists pushed out of Williamsburg and elsewhere move in.  There’s so much more in the neighborhood — easily,  30 or 40 businesses have opened in the past three years.  There are always something new happening in this vibrant and exiting neighborhood.

Thanks for checking out my listing!  It is a spare room I have in my apartment and I love to have guests from different parts of world stay and share a little time with me.  

I travel, trying to fit my dream destinations into my limited vacation days, planing to visit Portugal this fall and maybe Germany in the spring next year if I can find a time.  South America and Central America has always been on my mind but the dates never worked out so I haven't got a chance to go :/  The place I miss the most is Cuba, didn't enjoy that much of the hot weather but everything else in this country is just amazing, mind-blowing in a way.

I cook, and am a pretty good cook actually.  I invite my guests to share my cooking, through food I find it easy to learn different cultures :)

I enjoy arts, managed to start a career in theatre and doing fine so far.  If you need a tour of cultural activities in NYC, I'll be your best guide!

If you need to know more about me and my place, just shoot me a message!

A little about me - i enjoy travel, design, shopping, eating, movies and mostly meeting new people.

New York city is full of great restaurants and nightlife, which i thoroughly enjoy and am always trying out trendy new places.  Best of all - i live in one of the most trendy neighborhoods - the Meatpacking and West Village area.  You won't be disappointed if you stay at my apartment!  

I am a responsible and mature person. I like to keep my apartment very organized and will do the same for yours if you are hosting me.  I like to be out and about all day if I am visiting a city.  So i understand we all need a good bed and the basic comforts like a clean bathroom and space to lay your things things down. 

I've traveled to all the continents and looking to explore Asia some more next.  I love the food, beaches, cities and people.  However, my favorite city in the world is Paris and I hope to keep visiting there every year for the rest of my life. :)

I am fairly new to Airbnb, but am excited to explore it more and more as a tool to get to know people visiting from other countries. Airbnb adds flavor to any vacation, so i look forward to hosting you as well as visiting.

Look forward to meeting you soon!
